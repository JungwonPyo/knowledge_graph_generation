  "title": "The Solar-Powered Smart Farm in Seoul",
  "summary": "In 2022, engineer Kim Min-jun established a smart farm on Seoul's outskirts, integrating solar panels, automated irrigation, and AI monitoring to enable year-round vegetable production. Supported by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and a local startup incubator, the project demonstrates innovative agricultural technology. The solar energy system, installed in March 2022, powers water pumps, sensors, and robots while transmitting sensor data to a central computer every 10 minutes. By 2024, the farm achieved 60% lower electricity costs and 35% higher crop yields compared to traditional farms. It also serves as an educational site for residents and has inspired similar projects in Busan and Incheon. The Seoul government may provide additional funding if the project continues to show environmental and economic benefits. Kim plans to expand in 2026 with a strawberry greenhouse and educational classroom.",
